# Credit Card Checker 

This is the work I did for the Codecademy Javascript project for checking credit card numbers.

## Overview 

The project involved automating checking credit card numbers to see if they are valid or not and identify the bank issuing the faulty numbers . 

## Contains: 
- validateCred() - return true when an array contains digits of a valid credit card number and false when it is invalid using the Luhn algorithm. 
- findInvalidCards() - checks through a nested array for which numbers are invalid, and returns another nested array of invalid cards.
- idInvalidCardCompanies() - identifies the credit card companies that have possibly issued the faulty numbers
